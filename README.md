The Snack Shop API is a management system for snack bars that offers a series of advantages. It allows for efficient and intuitive ordering, improving the customer experience and optimizing employee time.

The "Snack Shop API" application is a management system for snack bars. It is designed to improve operational efficiency and provide a superior experience to customers. Here are the main business requirements that the application meets:

1. Order Management: The application allows for efficient and intuitive ordering. Users can list all orders, list an order by ID, add an order, and update the status of an order.

2. User Management: The application allows for user management. Users can be listed, added, updated, and removed. Additionally, users can be added to groups and have their passwords changed.

3. Group Management: The application allows for the management of user groups. Groups can be listed, added, updated, and removed. Additionally, permissions can be listed, added, and removed from a group.

4. Product Management: The application allows for product management. Products can be listed, added, updated, and removed.

5. Ingredient Management: The application allows for ingredient management. Ingredients can be listed, added, updated, and removed.

6. Payment Method Management: The application allows for payment method management. Payment methods can be listed, added, updated, and removed.

## üíª Technologies

The following tools were used in the project:

- [Java](https://www.java.com)
- [Spring Boot](https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot)
- [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/)
- [SQL](https://www.mysql.com/)

## ‚úÖ Prerequisites

Before you begin, you will need to have the following tools installed on your machine:
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop)
- [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)

## Architecture
![Local Architecture](src/main/resources/documentation/images/arquitetura-local.png)

## üöÄ How to run the project

### ‚öôÔ∏è Running the Backend (server)

```bash
# Clone this repository
$ git clone https://github.com/joseppamancio/snack-shop-api.git

# Access the project folder in the terminal/cmd
$ cd snack-shop-delivery

# Use Docker Compose to start the application and the database
$ docker-compose up
```

When you run the docker-compose up command, Docker Compose starts the application and the database in separate containers, but on the same Docker network. This allows the application and the database to communicate with each other. The database is started on the default port 3306.

The Spring Boot application, in turn, connects to this database through the Docker network. When the Spring Boot application starts, Flyway is executed. Flyway is a database migration tool that helps manage and apply changes to the database schema. It creates the necessary tables for interacting with the application, such as orders, users, products, and ingredients.

After creating the tables, a script called afterMigrate.sql is executed. This script populates the tables with fictitious data, allowing you to test the application. Finally, the application is exposed on port 9000. You can interact with the application through an HTTP client like Postman, calling the respective API endpoints.

## üìù API Documentation

To test the application, we provide a Postman collection containing several pre-configured requests. This collection is located in the src/main/resources/collections directory of the project. To import the collection into Postman, follow the steps below:

1. Open Postman.
2. Click on the "Import" button in the top left corner.
3. In the window that opens, select the "File" option.
4. Navigate to the src/main/resources/collections directory of the project and select the collection file.
5. Click "Open" to import the collection.

After importing the collection, you will see a list of requests in the left panel of Postman. You can click on any of these requests to open it and then click the "Send" button to send the request to the application. Remember that the application must be running on port 9000 for you to interact with it through Postman.

### üë• Groups

To list the groups registered in the application, we defined a folder within the Collection called Groups. In it, you will find the following requests:

- List all groups
- List group by ID
- Add Group
- Update Group
- Remove Group

- Add Permission to Group
- Remove Permission from Group

### Request Example
